        <h3>A bite-sized sweet treat that is great on its own or to end off any meal. </h3>
        <p>Hojicha (roasted green tea) originated from Kyoto about a century ago. When the roasted notes of hojicha custard meet the slight crunch of the tart, the subtle sweetness that entails on the tastebuds has an earthy and floral finish. </p>
        <p><em>Serves:</em> 6 pax</p></center>

            <em>For the Hojicha Custard</em>:
            <li>1/2 Cup Granulated Sugar or Brown Sugar</li>
            <li>3 1/2 Tbs Corn Starch</li>
            <li>2 Tbs Hojicha Powder</li>
            <li>1/4 Tsp Salt</li>
            <li>2 1/2 Cups Whole Milk</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup and 2 Tbs of Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
            <br>
            
            <em>For the Floral Garnish</em>:
            <li>8 g Dried Osmanthus Flowers</li>
            <li>8 g Dried Blue Pea Flowers</li>
            <li>8 g Dried Rose Buds</li>

            <li>A packet of small ready-made tarts (approximately 30 pieces)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the sugar, corn starch, Hojicha powder, and salt in a medium cooking pan. Pour in the milk and cream. Mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Heat the mixture over medium heat, constantly whisking to make sure that the mixture is as lump-free as possible. Heat until the mixture reaches a boil. Continue to cook for another minute or so (the longer you cook, the firmer the texture will be.)</li>
            <li>Strain the mixture with a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Place a cling wrap over the bowl and leave to cool for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Use a ladle to scoop the Hojicha custard into the tart shells.</li>
            <li>Mix the dried flowers together and garnish the tarts with the flowers.</li>
            <li>Chill the tarts for at least an hour or up to two days before serving. Enjoy!</li>
